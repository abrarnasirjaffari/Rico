    // Built-in 1: Startup Credit & Grant Drafter
    this.registerSkillFromMarkdown(`---
id: startup-credit-grant
name: Startup Credit & Grant Application Drafter
description: Guides founders to claim up to $50,000 PostHog, $5,000 AWS, and Notion AI credits, and crafts high-acceptance pitch summaries.
category: startup
persona: founder
version: 1.2.0
triggers:
  - startup credit
  - posthog credit
  - aws activate
  - notion grant
  - founder discount
  - zero burn stack
  - tech stack savings
toolsRequired:
  - check_persona_savings
  - create_mandate
---

## Instructions
When a user asks about startup discounts or cloud credits:
1. Probe their stage (bootstrapped, pre-seed, or funded) and current tech stack.
2. Check eligibility for PostHog ($50k over 12 months for startups under $5M funding), AWS Activate ($5k credits), and Notion AI ($1k).
3. Generate a tailored 1-paragraph traction summary matching official vendor acceptance criteria.
4. If they accept, configure their recurring mandate at $0.00 until credits expire.

## Rules
- NEVER advise founders to purchase full retail SaaS plans without first checking credit programs.
- Highlight the exact dollar amount of runway saved.
- Ensure all vendor application URLs point to official developer portals.

## Few-Shot Examples
### Example 1
User: Can Rico help my seed startup save on analytics and server costs?
Thought: User is a seed startup founder looking for cloud and analytics savings.
Assistant: I have activated the Startup Credit Drafter skill. You qualify for $50,000 in PostHog startup credits and $5,000 in AWS Activate credits, saving your team over $4,500/month in burn. Would you like me to generate your application pitch or set up your $0-burn spending rules?

    // Built-in 2: Student 50% Discount Enforcer
    this.registerSkillFromMarkdown(`---
id: student-discount-enforcer
name: Student 50% Discount Enforcer
description: Unlocks 50% student tiers for Spotify, Adobe Creative Cloud, Apple Music, and GitHub Student Developer Pack.
category: student
persona: student
version: 1.1.0
triggers:
  - student discount
  - college deal
  - university pricing
  - edu email
  - spotify student
  - adobe student
  - github student
toolsRequired:
  - verify_web_price
  - check_persona_savings
---

## Instructions
When a student inquires about subscriptions or services:
1. Verify their educational eligibility (.edu email address or SheerID/UNiDAYS check).
2. Look up the verified student rate (e.g. Spotify at $5.99/mo instead of $11.99/mo; Adobe at $19.99/mo instead of $59.99/mo).
3. Automatically apply the 50% discount to their budget ceiling before setting up recurring payments.

## Rules
- Cap spending mandates to the verified student rate.
- Notify the student 30 days before annual SheerID re-verification is required.

    // Built-in 3: Tax Deduction & Expense OCR Classifier
    this.registerSkillFromMarkdown(`---
id: tax-deduction-ocr
name: Tax Deduction & Business Expense Classifier
description: Classifies recurring transactions, receipts, and vendor invoices into IRS Schedule C tax deductible expense categories.
category: tax
persona: freelancer

triggers:
  - tax deduction
  - schedule c
  - write off
  - expense classification
  - receipt ocr
  - invoice deduction
  - business expense
toolsRequired:
  - create_mandate
---

## Instructions
When transactions or invoices are processed:
1. Analyze the vendor name, description, and itemized lines.
2. Map the purchase to IRS Schedule C categories:
   - Advertising & Marketing (Google Ads, Meta, PostHog)
   - Software & Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, OpenAI)
   - Office Expenses & Subscriptions (Zoom, Slack, Notion)
   - Professional Services (Legal, Accounting, Contractors via PayPal Payouts)
3. Calculate estimated tax savings assuming standard 25-30% self-employment and corporate tax rates.

## Rules
- Mark 100% ordinary and necessary business expenses as deductible.
- Require dual-use items (home internet, mobile phones) to specify business percentage (typically 50-80%).

    // Built-in 4: SaaS Renewal & Seat Optimization Negotiator
    this.registerSkillFromMarkdown(`---
id: saas-renewal-negotiator
name: SaaS Renewal & Seat Optimization Negotiator
description: Audits upcoming annual SaaS renewals, flags inactive zombie seats, and drafts vendor retention discount requests before lock-in windows close.
category: contract
persona: all

triggers:
  - saas renewal
  - zombie seats
  - annual lock-in
  - subscription negotiation
  - cancel trial
  - unused licenses
toolsRequired:
  - verify_web_price
  - check_persona_savings
---

## Instructions
When a user asks to audit SaaS contracts, reduce seat waste, or negotiate an upcoming renewal:
1. Identify the contract renewal date and verify whether a 30-day or 60-day notice window applies.
2. Audit active versus provisioned user seats to flag inactive zombie licenses.
3. Benchmark current per-seat pricing against published multi-year or retention discount tiers (typically 15-25% off list price).
4. Draft a concise vendor renewal counter-offer requesting seat right-sizing and price lock protection before the auto-renewal deadline.

## Rules
- Flag any contract within 60 days of annual auto-renewal as high priority.
- Recommend downgrading or removing seats with zero activity over the last 30 days before renewal execution.
- Never approve an automatic price increase exceeding the mandate ceiling without explicit user confirmation.
