## 💡 What is Rico?

**Rico** is an autonomous, open-source financial and agentic commerce assistant that unifies **AI Reasoning (Brain)**, **Live Headless Browser Automation (Hands)**, and the **Official PayPal AI Toolkit & MCP Server (Wallet)**.

Instead of a passive checkout button or retrospective spending charts, Rico allows users to issue natural language financial mandates:

> *"Pay Netflix $15.99 on the 5th, max $20"*  
> *"Track Adobe Creative Cloud, cap at $35/mo — alert my Telegram if prices spike"*  
> *"Pay Spotify $11.99, but check for student discounts first"*

Rico autonomously visits merchant sites in a real Chromium browser, extracts live pricing, hunts for student discounts and startup credits ($50,000 in PostHog credits, Notion credits), enforces strict budget guardrails, and executes authorized payments through PayPal's sandbox MCP server.

## 🌟 Key Features & Innovations

### 1. 🎮 Real-Time Live Browser Engine (Stagehand + Playwright CDP)
- **Zero Fakes / 100% Real:** Launches a genuine headless Chromium browser.
- **30FPS Live Screencast:** Streams raw JPEG frames directly into a React viewport window in real time.
- **Natural Language Actions:** Uses `stagehand.act("select Standard plan")` to click real buttons in the DOM.
- **Cryptographic Visual Proof:** Saves timestamped screenshot receipts with OCR bounding boxes.

### 2. 💳 Dual-Rail Smart Wallet & Zero-Knowledge Vault
- **Primary Rail:** PayPal Wallet & Balance (`buyer-sandbox@payagent.internal`).
- **Secondary Backup Rail:** Tokenized Visa (`•••• 4242`) & Mastercard (`•••• 5555`).
- **Zero-Knowledge AI Security:** Card numbers are entered in an isolated PayPal Hosted Iframe (`@paypal/paypal-js`). The AI model **NEVER SEES** raw card numbers or CVVs, eliminating PCI liability and model training leaks!
- **Persistent Sessions:** Tokens are stored in SQLite; users never re-enter card information across sessions.

### 3. 📱 24/7 Price Sentinel & Omnichannel Bot Team
- **Scheduled Audits:** `POST /api/cron/sentinel` audits all active mandates when an external daily scheduler calls it (see *Scheduled Monitoring* below). Audits never make payments.
- **Interactive Messaging:** Telegram alerts when a bot is configured. WhatsApp and Slack message formats exist, but nothing is sent yet.
- **1-Tap Action Callbacks:** Remote `[Approve One-Time]`, `[Pay with Backup Card]`, or `[1-Click Cancel Subscription]` buttons executed right from the chat notification.

### 4. 🚀 Persona-Based Savings & Credit Optimizer ("AI That Pays for Itself")
- **Startup / Founder Profile:** Automatically checks and claims **$50,000 PostHog credits** and **$1,000 Notion startup credits** before recurring payments execute.
- **Student Profile:** Enforces 50% education discounts (Spotify Student $5.99/mo, GitHub Student Developer Pack).
- **Active Coupon Hunter:** Scrapes and tests working promo codes in merchant checkout fields before generating PayPal invoices.

### 5. 📊 AG Grid Financial Command Center
- Real-time mandate schedules, budget ceiling utilizations, and transaction audit trails.
- One-click CSV audit export and live filtering.

## 🚀 Quickstart & Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or 20+
- Google Gemini API Key ([Get free API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))
- PayPal Developer Sandbox Account ([developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard))

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrarnasirjaffari/Rico.git
cd Rico
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
Fill in your credentials:
```env
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_sandbox_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_sandbox_client_secret
PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
PAYPAL_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://mcp.sandbox.paypal.com/sse
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
DATABASE_URL=./sqlite.db
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
# Run core financial platform & agent dashboard:
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 4. Run Marketing Website & Documentation
```bash
# Run marketing landing page, docs, workflows & pricing:
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

### 5. Scheduled Monitoring (Optional)
Rico does not start a scheduler by itself. To run daily audits, set `CRON_SECRET` on the server to a random value of at least 32 characters (for example `openssl rand -hex 32`), then have an external scheduler send one request a day:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://YOUR-RICO-HOST/api/cron/sentinel" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" --max-time 300
```
Any scheduler that can send this request works, such as a Render Cron Job or a GitHub Actions `schedule` workflow with the secret stored in its secrets. The server needs Playwright's Chromium, because only live prices are trusted.

| Response | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Audit finished; the body has counts only |
| `401` | Missing or wrong secret |
| `409` | Another audit is already running; do not retry straight away |
| `503` | `CRON_SECRET` is missing or shorter than 32 characters |

The Sentinel panel shows *Scheduled* only after a successful run in the last 26 hours.
